{__REPLACE_WITH_PROGRAM_0__}

See the complete list in [this page](docs/CompleteList.md).

## Usage

All solutions are in the [Solutions](Solutions) folder.

In Quera, the structure of the questions link is as follows: https://quera.org/problemset/{Problem-ID-As-Number}

We keep all problem solutions in a folder called `Quera ID`. For example, the solutions
to [this problem](https://quera.org/problemset/10163/) with id `10163` are located in folder `10163`
inside [Solutions](Solutions) folder.

Every problem can be solved with different languages. For example, `C#`, `Python`, etc. To separate the languages, we
save each language in a folder with its own name. For example, for `C#`, the solution is placed in a folder
called `csharp`.

For example, the tree structure of a problem can look like this:

- Solutions
    - 10163
        - csharp
            - program.cs
            - README.md
        - python
            - program.py
            - README.md
    - 10166
        - javascript
            - program.js
            - README.md
        - csharp
            - solution1.cs
            - solution2.cs
            - README.md

For see default templates, you can see [this section](Templates).

### Documentation

Codes usually do not need additional explanations. We try to make the codes clean, readable, and with comments.

In some cases, more explanations are needed, which are included in the solution `README` file. for example
see [this readme](Solutions/2551/csharp/README.md).

## About Readme.md

This file is generated [automatically](.github/workflows/update-readme.yml). You can see the source of this program in
the [Readme Generator](ReadmeGenerator) directory.

This project uses [the Payadel README template](https://github.com/Payadel/Readme/).

### Why readme is auto-generated?

I didn't want to manually update the table in this file every time a problem was solved. This is repetitive work and
programmers hate repetitive work!

### How does readme generated?

In summary, the list of problems and solutions is read from the [Solutions](Solutions) folder, and the processed
information is placed in [this format](ReadmeGenerator/Data/ReadmeTemplate.md).
